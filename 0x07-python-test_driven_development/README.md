## Introduction

Welcome to the Python - Test-driven development project! In this project, you will learn and practice the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) using Python. TDD is a software development approach that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code. This project aims to help you understand the importance of TDD, how to write effective tests, and how to document your code properly.

## Getting Started

## Project Structure

Your project should follow this structure:

- `README.md`: This documentation file.
- `tests/`: A folder for all your test files (with `.txt` extension).
- `pycodestyle`: Ensure your code adheres to the PEP 8 style guide.
- `All your modules and functions should have proper documentation.`

## Resources

Here are some resources you can refer to for this project:

- [doctest - Test interactive Python examples](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html)
- [Unit Tests in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)

## Conclusion

This project is an excellent opportunity to dive into Test-Driven Development using Python. By the end of this project, you'll have a deeper understanding of the importance of writing tests and documenting your code properly. Good luck, and happy coding!

If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to your ALX mentor or fellow learners.
