# Project Title: Python Object-Relational Mapping with SQLAlchemy

## Overview
This project aims to explore the integration of Python with MySQL databases using two different approaches - direct SQL queries with MySQLdb and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) with SQLAlchemy. By the end of this project, you'll have a good understanding of connecting to a MySQL database, executing queries, and utilizing SQLAlchemy for a more Pythonic way of interacting with databases.

## Project Details

### Part 1: MySQLdb
In this section, we'll use the MySQLdb module to establish a connection to a MySQL database and perform basic SQL operations.

#### Tasks:

# Your MySQLdb code here


# Your SQLAlchemy ORM code here


## Getting Started

To run the code, make sure you have the required dependencies installed in a virtual environment.
