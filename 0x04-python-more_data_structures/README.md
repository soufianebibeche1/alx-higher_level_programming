# Python Project: More Data Structures - Set, Dictionary

## Overview
This project is aimed at strengthening your understanding of Python's data structures, including sets and dictionaries, as well as functional programming concepts like lambda functions, map, reduce, and filter. You will learn when and how to use these data structures and functions effectively.

## General Info
- **Why Python programming is awesome:** Python is a versatile and powerful programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and a wide range of applications. Understanding Python can open doors to various fields, from web development to data analysis and machine learning.

- **What are sets and how to use them:** Sets are an unordered collection of unique elements. They are used for tasks where uniqueness matters, such as removing duplicates from a list.

- **What are dictionaries and how to use them:** Dictionaries are a collection of key-value pairs, where keys are unique identifiers for values. They are useful for organizing data with a specific association.

- **What is a key in a dictionary:** A key in a dictionary is a unique identifier used to access a specific value. Keys are typically strings, numbers, or other immutable types.

- **What is a lambda function:** A lambda function is a small, anonymous function that can have any number of input parameters but can only have one expression. They are often used for short, throwaway functions.

- **What are the map, reduce, and filter functions:** These are higher-order functions that enable concise data manipulation in Python. `map` applies a function to every item in an iterable. `filter` returns items from an iterable based on a given condition. `reduce` applies a rolling computation to sequential elements in an iterable.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you are expected to:

- Explain why Python programming is valuable and versatile.
- Understand the use of sets and dictionaries in Python.
- Know when to choose sets, dictionaries, or lists for specific tasks.
- Comprehend the concept of keys in dictionaries.
- Be familiar with lambda functions and their application.
- Use the map, reduce, and filter functions for data manipulation.

## Project Details
This project is divided into tasks that cover the topics mentioned in the learning objectives. Ensure that you complete each task individually to gain a deep understanding of the subject matter.
