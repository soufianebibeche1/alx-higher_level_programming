- README.md file at the root of the repo and in the project folder
- Code follows pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All files must be executable
- Length of files tested using wc
- Modules have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- Use 'get' to access dictionary value by key
