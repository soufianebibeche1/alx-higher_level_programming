# Python Inheritance Project

## Overview

This project is part of the ALX software engineering program and focuses on Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, particularly Inheritance.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you will be able to explain:

- Why Python programming is awesome
- What a superclass, base class, or parent class is
- What a subclass is
- How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
- When an instance can have new attributes
- How to inherit a class from another
- How to define a class with multiple base classes
- What is the default class every class inherits from
- How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class
- Which attributes or methods are available by heritage to subclasses
- The purpose of inheritance
- How to use isinstance, issubclass, type, and super built-in functions

## Requirements

- Python Scripts: Your code should follow these requirements.
- Python Test Cases: Your test cases should adhere to these requirements.
- Documentation: Ensure your code, classes, and functions have proper documentation.
