0x00. Python - Hello, World
Python Logo

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and exercises to introduce you to the world of Python programming. Each task is designed to help you grasp the fundamentals of Python and develop your coding skills. By the end of this project, you'll have a solid understanding of Python and its core concepts.

Learning Objectives
Upon completing this project, you should be able to:

Explain why Python programming is awesome.
Identify the creator of Python and describe their significance.
Understand the origins of the name 'Python.'
Describe the Zen of Python philosophy and its guiding principles.
Utilize the Python interpreter effectively.
Print text and variables using Python's print function.
Work with strings, including string formatting.
Understand indexing and slicing in Python.
Adhere to the official Python coding style (PEP8) and check your code using pycodestyle.

Zen of Python
Here are some guiding principles from the Zen of Python by Tim Peters:

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than right now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
